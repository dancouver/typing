The sun rose above the horizon, casting a golden hue over the landscape.

On a rainy day, the city seemed to slow down. Raindrops tapped against the windows, creating a soothing rhythm.

As night fell, the city transformed into a world of lights. Neon signs illuminated the streets, casting a colorful glow.
